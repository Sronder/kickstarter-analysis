# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends,
specifically US plays (both successful and failed campaigns)
and data for future projects in Great Britain.

I will add images of charts and graphs here

For the Kickstarter Campaign, I recommend a fundraising date range of beginning of May through the end of June, as these are the months with the highest participation.

Making your goal ambitious yet reasonable is best, as most failed campaigns had very high goals with low pledged amounts.
